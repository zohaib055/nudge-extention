        <p><strong>A Nothing is a currency you earn when you close a site after being nudged.</strong></p>
        <p>Every Nothing stands for a time that you quit an addictive site.</p>
        <p><strong>They're called Nothings because they are worth nothing.</strong></p>
        <p>But that doesn't mean they don't matter. Having a lot of Nothings means a lot of extra moments in your life kissing goodbye to crappy stuff and saying hello to slightly better stuff.</p>
        <p><strong>Because they are worth nothing, you can spend Nothings on things that money can't buy (cheesy, huh?).</strong></p>
        <p>Spend them on being farther from your computer, or closer to family, or switching to a site that you enjoy more, or planning dinner with friends, or doing exercise, or watching a favorite TV show.</p>
        <p>Nothings aren't about getting you to work harder &mdash; they're about helping you spend time in a better way.</p>
